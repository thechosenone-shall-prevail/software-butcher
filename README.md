# Software Butcher

Slicing away the corporate fat to leave your vulnerabilities bleeding on the floor. One chef, one cleaver, zero chatter.

Autonomous security assessment harness built around one idea: let an
opinionated reasoning engine and a collection of lightweight "shelves" run
continuous, evidence-driven assessment workflows and produce an actionable
technical verdict — clear, humane, and accountable.

Software Butcher composes several focused components to automate modern red
team and bug-bounty workflows:

- The Brain: an LLM-driven advisor and deterministic policy that selects
  the next capability to run against a hypothesis — a restrained voice
  that prefers evidence over speculation.
- Shelves & Adapters: thin adapters that translate Brain intent into concrete
  tool executions (HexStrike is the primary shelf/adapter used by default).
- Runner & Artifacts: `SafeRunner` and `ShelfRunner` drive external tools,
  capture stdout/stderr, and persist artifacts for later synthesis and review.
- State & Synthesis: a persistent `FindingStore` and synthesizer create an
  evidence-backed verdict (`secure`, `partially_hardened`, or `compromised`).

Architecture

![Software Butcher architecture](docs/Architecture.jpg)

Quick start

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
2. Prepare a scope (targets) and run the framework using the CLI entrypoint:

```bash
python -m software_butcher --scope my-scope.json --output ./workspace
```

Key concepts

- `ButcherProject` — workspace abstraction holding scope, inventory and findings.
- `run_brain_once()` — core loop: pick a hypothesis, select capability (LLM or
  policy), route to an adapter, execute, and ingest findings.
- `AdapterRequest` / `AdapterResult` — normalized contract between Brain and
  shelves; implement `plan`, `execute`, `normalize_results` in new adapters.
- `SessionStore` — persists cookies/tokens and now tracks post-exploit shell
  sessions to enable command chaining across tool runs.
- `Synthesizer` — converts finding state into a reproducible report and fixes.

Extending Software Butcher

- Add a new shelf/adapter under `software_butcher/shelves/` implementing the
  `FrameworkAdapter` interface in `software_butcher/core/adapter.py`.
- Register adapters with the global registry or via configuration so the Brain
  can route capabilities to them.

Development notes

- LLM integration is optional — the system will fall back to deterministic
  policies when a model is not configured.
- Artifacts and results are stored under `software_butcher/artifacts/` for
  reproducibility and manual inspection.

## Philosophy

| Principle | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| No multi-agent orchestration | One Brain, not role-playing agents with message explosion |
| Finding state is truth | `finding_state.json` is auditable, diffable, resumable |
| Shelf executes, Brain thinks | Tools run; interpretation and routing live in the Brain |
| Models are configurable | An LLM advisor may be used when configured; deterministic
|                  | policies remain the reliable fallback |
| Ensemble via state, not swarms | Parallel reasoning passes converge on shared findings |

---

## Three foundations

### Shelf — execution layer

HexStrike is the default foundation: 150+ security tools behind a Flask API on port `8888`. The Shelf does not reason — it receives scoped commands and returns raw output.

Additional adapters plug in without changing the Brain contract:

- **HexStrike** — discovery, scanning, exploitation tooling
- **Playwright/Curl** — web behavior and auth-bypass probing
- **Binary triage** — local entropy/strings/symbols
- **Caldera / Atomic Red Team / Stratus** — adversary emulation
- **BOAZ / Sliver** — payload evasion and C2 (when configured)

### Brain — reasoning loop

We slice right through the legacy fat to serve up the juicy, vulnerable meat underneath
*The hunter that chooses which component to target next.*

1. Pop the next hypothesis (priority-sorted, optionally reordered by the advisor)
2. Read current findings and decide intent/capability (LLM advisor JSON or deterministic policy fallback)
3. Route to the correct shelf adapter
4. Interpret adapter output into structured findings
5. Generate follow-up hypotheses (SQLi, XSS, AD, cloud, auth escalation, …)
6. Write everything back to finding state and repeat

### Brain — Progressive Convergence Search (PCS)

The Brain does **not** always run N parallel branches. PCS adapts: 

We don't guess; we smell blood and carve precisely where it hurts.

| Trigger | Branches | Behavior |
|---------|----------|----------|
| No high-value evidence yet | **1** | Primary path only — cheap |
| Confirmed / high-confidence finding | **3** | Evidence-triggered exploration |
| Conflicting path themes | **+2** (up to 5) | Widen search |
| Convergence score ≥ 0.75 | **1** | Validation mode — confirm, don't branch |

Each finding carries **emergent confidence**: a calm, numeric sense of how
much the evidence truly supports the claim.

```json
{
  "hypothesis": "Auth bypass on /login",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "supporting_paths": 3,
  "opposing_paths": 1,
  "convergence_score": 0.83,
  "evidence_count": 12,
  "cluster_theme": "auth_bypass",
  "emergent_confidence": 0.76
}
```

### Engagement phases (post-exploit state)

Finding state tracks `engagement.phase`:

`recon` → `exploit` → `foothold` → `privesc` → `exfil` → `complete`

Phase transitions drive HTB-aware hypotheses (`user.txt`, `root.txt`, privesc enumeration).

### Confirmation pipeline

Findings promote `hypothesis` → `confirmed` when:

- Adapter marks capability `*_confirmed`
- `required_evidence` ⊆ `observed_evidence`
- Convergence score ≥ 0.70 with ≥ 2 supporting paths
- Emergent confidence ≥ 0.75 with ≥ 3 supporting paths

### Synthesis — verdict layer

 Laying out the raw, bleeding facts of how your perimeter got skinned.

- **Verdict**: `secure` · `partially_hardened` · `compromised`
- Cited findings, reproduction steps, and remediation hints
- Markdown or JSON output

Synthesis prefers transparent, auditable rules; when an LLM is configured it
can assist with phrasing and summarization, but verdicts always cite the
underlying evidence.

## Quick start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd software-butcher
sudo ./setup.sh --minimal          # Python deps + essential tools
# or
sudo ./setup.sh                    # ~60 core tools
# or
sudo ./setup.sh --full --with-cloud
```

Install via pip (recommended):

```bash
pip install -e .
# or with HexStrike server deps:
pip install -e ".[hexstrike,dev]"
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install openai requests
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start HexStrike server

```bash
python3 hexstrike_server.py --port 8888
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/ | head
```

### 3. Configure scope

Software Butcher uses a **flat** scope file for its CLI guard. Generate one:

```bash
python3 -m software_butcher init-scope scope.json \
  --name my-assessment \
  --domain example.com \
  --url https://example.com
```

Example `scope.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-assessment",
  "allowed_domains": ["example.com"],
  "allowed_cidrs": [],
  "allowed_urls": ["https://example.com"],
  "allowed_files": [],
  "max_tool_calls": 50,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

> **Note:** `scope.json.example` is a comprehensive scope document. The CLI `Scope.load()` accepts both flat files and this nested format automatically.

### 4. Configure an external LLM provider (optional)

Software Butcher can integrate with an external LLM for advisory and synthesis tasks.
We recommend using OpenRouter with `gpt-oss-120b` (free) for general-purpose use.

Example environment variables (add to `.env`):

```
# OpenRouter (preferred)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# Optional: select model (defaults to OpenRouter `gpt-oss-120b` free tier)
LLM_MODEL=gpt-oss-120b

# Legacy DeepSeek removed — use OpenRouter instead
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY is no longer used; configure OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

The CLI will load `.env` automatically when you run `software_butcher`.

### 5. Run an assessment

```bash
python3 -m software_butcher run \
  --scope scope.json \
  --target https://example.com \
  --workspace software_butcher/workspaces/my-run \
  --steps 25 \
  --no-new-limit 5
```

Outputs:

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `workspaces/my-run/finding_state.json` | All findings + hypothesis queue |
| `workspaces/my-run/session_state.json` | Auth cookies / session data |
| `software_butcher/artifacts/` | Raw stdout/stderr per tool run |

## Data model

### Finding

Written by the Brain after each tool run:

```json
{
  "id": "finding-abc123",
  "hypothesis": "Endpoint discovered via HTML crawl",
  "path": "https://example.com/admin",
  "provenance": "hexstrike:html_crawl",
  "status": "hypothesis",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "evidence": ["https://example.com/admin"],
  "asset_type": "web_endpoint",
  "parent_path": "https://example.com",
  "schema_version": "0.1"
}
```

Status values: `hypothesis` · `confirmed` · `dismissed`

### Hypothesis queue

Work items the Brain consumes:

```json
{
  "id": "hyp-def456",
  "path": "https://example.com/admin",
  "reason": "Admin/auth surface should receive behavior-level validation.",
  "source_finding_id": "finding-abc123",
  "priority": 0.8,
  "status": "pending",
  "metadata": { "intent": "web_behavior_analysis", "asset_type": "web_endpoint" }
}
```

---

## Brain routing

When an external LLM (OpenRouter) is available, the Brain can ask it
for a JSON capability choice against the last 10 findings. On failure or missing
key, deterministic policy takes over (`brain/policy.py`).

Capability → adapter mapping (simplified):

| Signal / intent | Adapter |
|-----------------|---------|
| `discover`, `port_scanning`, `vulnerability_scanning`, … | HexStrike |
| `web_behavior_analysis` | Playwright/Curl |
| `reverse_engineer` | Binary triage |
| `validate_ad_emulation` | Caldera |
| `validate_cloud_attack_path` | Stratus |
| `deep_fuzz`, `payload_evasion` | BOAZ |

Full capability list is declared on `HexstrikeAdapter.capabilities` in `shelves/hexstrike/adapter.py`.

---

## Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it hexstrike_app bash
python3 hexstrike_server.py --port 8888
```

The Dockerfile ships a Kali-based image with core tools pre-installed. The container starts in interactive bash; start the server manually inside.

## License / usage

Software Butcher and HexStrike are offensive-security tooling. Run only against targets you are explicitly authorized to test. Scope files exist to enforce that boundary at the harness level — out-of-scope targets are rejected before any tool executes.
